## Using JIRA Cloud

As a government user we expect a good degree of sophistication when working with data. We have a shared responsibility to keep the right things safe. This guidance will help you use [JIRA Cloud](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/features) to collaborate securely with colleagues.

[JIRA Cloud](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) is an issue and task tracking application, developed by Atlassian. It provides bug tracking, issue tracking, and project management functions.

### Securing your account

Secure your JIRA Cloud account by using:

- a password made up of [3 random words](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/three-random-words-or-thinkrandom-0)
- a secure (HTTPS) connection and a [modern browser](https://whatbrowser.org) or JIRA [mobile app](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/mobile-app)

If you have a corporate Google (G Suite) account use this to log in to JIRA, and [enable two factor authentication](https://www.google.com/landing/2step/) on that account.

Tell your JIRA administrator if you:

- think someone may have accessed your account
- lose a device that can access your JIRA account (you should also [reset your password](https://id.atlassian.com/login/resetpassword))

### Protecting your data

To protect your data when using JIRA, make sure you:

- don&#39;t use JIRA to store [sensitive, personal](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/key-definitions/), or other high value data (like commercial or financial information) that could cause harm or embarrassment if lost or exposed
- [restrict access to boards](https://confluence.atlassian.com/agile/jira-agile-user-s-guide/configuring-a-board#ConfiguringaBoard-Sharingaboard) when you need to control access

When using JIRA, you should also be aware that content, including archived or private content, can be:

- disclosed publicly under the [Freedom of Information Act](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-freedom-of-information/what-is-the-foi-act/)
- [backed up and viewed](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiracloud/exporting-issues-776636787.html) by administrators in JIRA accounts, including content not shared with them
- [subject to legal requests to share data](https://www.atlassian.com/legal/privacy-policy) by courts, government agencies, or parties involved in litigation in the US

Atlassian - the company that runs JIRA - have signed up to the [EU-US Privacy Shield](https://www.atlassian.com/legal/privacy-policy) which requires them to follow European data protection requirements for personal data for their European customers. [You own the data](https://www.atlassian.com/legal/privacy-policy) you put in JIRA, and their technical security is similar to other popular public cloud services.

### Managing information

You must record or summarise important work in a permanent record at regular intervals or at the end of a piece of work.

Make sure you don't lose content by:

- creating a permanent record of shared information at regular intervals or at the end of a piece of work
- using your document storage or email service to capture important discussions or decisions (name the data so it can be found later)

You can export data from JIRA by:

- copying and pasting the text (while noting the date)
- asking your administrator for [a backup](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiracloud/exporting-issues-776636787.html)
- [printing cards](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwarecloud/printing-issue-cards-785332012.html) either to paper or PDF

### Getting started

Ensure your account looks official and similar to other government JIRA accounts by:

- setting your full name in [your profile](https://id.atlassian.com/profile)
- use a recognisable profile photo
- add your role to the Job title section
- add your organisation
