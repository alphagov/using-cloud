## Using Trello securely

Government staff are responsible for checking the applications they use are secure. This guidance will help you use Trello to work securely with colleagues.

[Trello](https://trello.com/) is a cloud application for managing projects and sharing tasks.

### Secure your account

Secure your Trello account by using:

* a password made up of 3 random words
* [two-factor authentication](http://help.trello.com/article/993-enabling-two-factor-authentication-for-your-trello-account)
* a secure HTTPS connection (ensure this by using a [modern browser](https://whatbrowser.org/) or a [Trello client app](https://trello.com/platforms)

Contact your Trello administrator if you:

* think someone may have accessed your account (you should also [change your password immediately](https://trello.com/forgot?user=)
* lose a device that can access Trello (you should also [sign yourself out of other sessions](http://help.trello.com/article/766-logging-out-of-trello)

### Protect your data

To protect your data when using Trello, make sure you:

* don't use Trello to store [sensitive, personal](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/key-definitions/), or other high value data (like commercial or financial information) that could cause harm if lost or exposed
* create [public and private boards](http://help.trello.com/article/789-changing-the-visibility-of-a-board-to-public-private-or-team) as appropriate
* don’t connect Trello to [other services](https://trello.com/integrations)

When using Trello, you should also be aware that content can be:

* disclosed publicly under the [Freedom of Information Act](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-freedom-of-information/what-is-the-foi-act/), as could any information held by government
* retrieved by board owners or central administrators in paid Trello accounts
* seen by Trello staff (card titles show up in Trello system logs, so choose them carefully)

Trello [signed-up](https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000TOWpAAO) to the [EU-US Privacy Shield](https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome) which requires them to follow European data protection requirements for European customers. [You own the data](https://trello.com/privacy) you put in Trello, and their technical security is similar to other popular public cloud services.

### Managing information

You must record or summarise important work in a permanent record at regular intervals or at the end of a piece of work.

Make sure you don’t lose content by:

* creating a permanent record of shared information at regular intervals or at the end of a piece of work
* using your document storage or email service to capture important discussions or decisions (name the data so it can be found later)
* including a link to the Trello board in related documents
* share boards that may be of historical interest with your information management team
* delete old cards of no historical value to reduce the volume of data that needs to be managed - [archived first then delete](http://help.trello.com/customer/portal/articles/935742-archiving-and-deleting-cards)
* [close boards](http://help.trello.com/article/801-deleting-a-board) when they are no longer needed

You can export data from Trello by:

* copying and pasting the text (while noting the date)
* [print](http://help.trello.com/article/812-printing-in-trello) to a PDF
* [export to CSV](http://help.trello.com/article/747-exporting-data-from-trello-1) if you have a Business Class (paid for) account
* taking a screenshot
* asking your administrator for [an export](http://help.trello.com/article/747-exporting-data-from-trello-1)

### Getting started 
Ensure your account looks official and similar to other government Trello accounts by:

* setting your username to first_last_organisation (for example alex_black_moj)
* use a recognisable profile photo
* add your role to the Bio section

Your Trello profile [is public](https://trello.com/nick_woodcraft_gds), but doesn’t show up in web searches or include activity, comments, cards, organisation, or other details.

You can alert others to content you have shared on Trello using @mention in a card comment (for example @alex_black_moj). Take the [Trello tour](https://trello.com/tour) to find out more.

### Getting help
