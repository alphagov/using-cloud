## Using Confluence Cloud securely

Government staff are responsible for checking the applications they use are secure. This guidance will help you use Confluence Cloud to collaborate securely with colleagues.

[Confluence Cloud](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence) is a collaboration application for creating, organising, and discuss work in a team. You can use it to create and manage content, comment and suggest changes.

### Securing your account

Secure your Confluence Cloud account by using:

- a password made up of [3 random words](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/three-random-words-or-thinkrandom-0)
- a secure (HTTPS) connection and a [modern browser](https://whatbrowser.org/) or Confluence  [mobile app](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/mobile-app)

If you have a corporate Google (G Suite) account use this to log in to Confluence, and [enable two factor authentication](https://www.google.com/landing/2step/) on that account.

Tell your Confluence administrator if you:

- think someone may have accessed your account
- lose a device that can access your Confluence account (you should also [reset your password](https://confluence.atlassian.com/confcloud/change-your-password-724765385.html))

You can also [revoke OAuth access](https://confluence.atlassian.com/confcloud/view-and-revoke-oauth-access-tokens-724765409.html) if you&#39;ve enabled it.

### Protecting your data

To protect your data when using Confluence, make sure you:

- don&#39;t use Confluence to store [sensitive, personal](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/key-definitions/), or other high value data (like commercial or financial information) that could cause harm or embarrassment if lost or exposed
- [restrict access to pages and spaces](https://confluence.atlassian.com/confcloud/permissions-and-restrictions-724765432.html) when you need to control access

When using Confluence, you should also be aware that content, including archived or private content, can be:

- disclosed publicly under the [Freedom of Information Act](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-freedom-of-information/what-is-the-foi-act/)
- [backed up and viewed](https://confluence.atlassian.com/confcloud/create-a-site-backup-724765526.html) by administrators in Confluence accounts, including content not shared with them
- [subject to legal requests to share data](https://www.atlassian.com/legal/privacy-policy) by courts, government agencies, or parties involved in litigation in the US

Atlassian - the company that runs Confluence - have signed up to the [EU-US Privacy Shield](https://www.atlassian.com/legal/privacy-policy) which requires them to follow European data protection requirements for personal data for their European customers. [You own the data](https://www.atlassian.com/legal/privacy-policy) you put in Confluence, and their technical security is similar to other popular public cloud services.

### Managing information

You must record or summarise important work in a permanent record at regular intervals or at the end of a piece of work.

Make sure you don&#39;t lose content by:

- creating a permanent record of shared information at regular intervals or at the end of a piece of work
- using your document storage or email service to capture important discussions or decisions (name the data so it can be found later)

You can export data from Confluence by:

- copying and pasting the text (while noting the date)
- [exporting documents to other formats](https://confluence.atlassian.com/confcloud/export-content-to-word-pdf-html-and-xml-724764824.html)
- asking your administrator for  [a backup](https://confluence.atlassian.com/confcloud/create-a-site-backup-724765526.html)

### Getting started

Ensure your account looks official and similar to other government Confluence accounts by:

- setting your @mention name to FirstLastORGANISATION (for example AlexBlackMOJ)
- use a recognisable profile photo
- add your role to the Job title section

### Getting help

For help using Confluence, you can read their [getting started guide](https://confluence.atlassian.com/confcloud/get-started-777009909.html)
