## Using HipChat securely

Government staff are responsible for checking the applications they use are secure. This guidance will help you use HipChat to communicate securely with colleagues.

[HipChat](https://www.atlassian.com/software/hipchat) is a cloud application for internal chat and messaging, either 1-to-1 or in a group. You can also use it to store files, make video calls, and search message history.

### Securing your account

Secure your HipChat account by using:

- a password made up of [3 random words](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/three-random-words-or-thinkrandom-0)
- a secure (HTTPS) connection and a [ ](https://whatbrowser.org/) [modern browser](https://whatbrowser.org/) or a [ ](https://www.hipchat.com/downloads) [HipChat client app](https://www.hipchat.com/downloads)

If you have a corporate Google (G Suite) account use this to log in to HipChat, and [enable two factor authentication](https://www.google.com/landing/2step/) on that account.

Tell your HipChat administrator if you:

- think someone may have accessed your account
- lose a device that can access your HipChat account (you should also [reset your password](https://confluence.atlassian.com/hipchat/your-profile-753404078.html))

You can also [deactivate your account](https://confluence.atlassian.com/hipchatkb/deleting-your-account-753404162.html) to prevent anyone from accessing it. Your administrator can reactivate your account later.

### Protecting your data

To protect your data when using HipChat, make sure you:

- don&#39;t use HipChat to store [ ](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/key-definitions/) [sensitive, personal](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/key-definitions/), or other high value data (like commercial or financial information) that could cause harm or embarrassment if lost or exposed
- use [1-to-1 chats](https://confluence.atlassian.com/hipchat/chat-in-rooms-740001121.html) when you need to control access
- [restrict your HipChat account t](https://blog.hipchat.com/2016/04/25/domain-validated-signups-save-admins-time/) [o your domain](https://blog.hipchat.com/2016/04/25/domain-validated-signups-save-admins-time/) if appropriate

Preserve an open working culture by only using  [private channels](https://confluence.atlassian.com/hipchat/chat-in-rooms-740001121.html) when absolutely necessary.

When using HipChat, you should also be aware that content, including archived or private content, can be:

- disclosed publicly under the [ ](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-freedom-of-information/what-is-the-foi-act/) [Freedom of Information Act](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-freedom-of-information/what-is-the-foi-act/)
- [exported and viewed](https://confluence.atlassian.com/hipchatkb/exporting-chat-history-753404166.html) by administrators in paid HipChat accounts, including private rooms, but not 1-to-1 chats
- [accessed on request by your administrator](https://confluence.atlassian.com/hipchat/chat-history-744525822.html) if not included in the export above, including 1-to-1 chats.
- [subject to legal requests to share data](https://www.atlassian.com/legal/privacy-policy) by courts, government agencies, or parties involved in litigation in the US

Using HipChat for social or personal use must:

- not create exposure to legal liability or embarrassment
- not affect your performance or disrupt others
- follow the  [Civil Service Code](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-service-code/the-civil-service-code)

Images or files in HipChat [can be accessed by anyone with the link](https://confluence.atlassian.com/hipchat/share-files-744525756.html), even if they can&#39;t access the room or chat it was posted to.

Atlassian - the company that runs HipCHat - have signed up to the [EU-US Privacy Shield](https://www.atlassian.com/legal/privacy-policy) which requires them to follow European data protection requirements for personal data for their European customers. [You own the data](https://www.atlassian.com/legal/privacy-policy) you put in HipChat, and their technical security is similar to other popular public cloud services.

### Managing information

You must record or summarise important work in a permanent record at regular intervals or at the end of a piece of work.

Make sure you don&#39;t lose content by:

- creating a permanent record of shared information at regular intervals or at the end of a piece of work
- using your document storage or email service to capture important discussions or decisions (name the data so it can be found later)

You can export data from HipChat by:

- copying and pasting the text (while noting the date)
- taking a screenshot
- asking your administrator for [an export](https://confluence.atlassian.com/hipchatkb/exporting-chat-history-753404166.html)

### Getting started

Ensure your account looks official and similar to other government HipChat accounts by:

- setting your @mention name to FirstLastORGANISATION (for example AlexBlackMOJ)
- use a recognisable profile photo
- add your role to the Job title section

You can alert others to content you have shared on HipChat by typing @all or @here. This can trigger notifications on their computer or phone. You can read the HipChat guidance on &#39; [Making an announcement](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202009646-Make-an-announcement)&#39; to understand how these alerts working the meaning of these alerts.
