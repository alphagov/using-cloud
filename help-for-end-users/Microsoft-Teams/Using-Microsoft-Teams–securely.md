## Using Microsoft Teams in Government

Government staff are responsible for checking the applications they use are secure. This guidance will help you use Teams to communicate securely with colleagues.

[Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com) is a cloud-based set of team collaboration tools and services that provide group text, voice, and video chat and connects to SharePoint and Outlook calendar to support collaboration. 

### Securing your account
Teams is part of the Microsoft Office 365 suite of applications, so your access is secured in the same was as other Office 365 applications. This should include:  

* a password made up of [3 random words](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/three-random-words-or-thinkrandom-0)
* [two-factor authentication](https://aka.ms/MFASetup)
* a secure (HTTPS) connection and a [modern browser](https://whatbrowser.org/) or the [Microsoft Teams client](https://teams.microsoft.com/downloads)

Tell your Teams administrator if you :

* think someone may have accessed your account
* lose a device that can access your Teams account (so they can [sign you out on that device](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/educloud/2017/06/14/how-to-kill-an-active-user-session-in-office-365/))

### Protecting your data

To protect your data when using Teams, make sure you:

* don't use Teams to store [sensitive, personal](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/key-definitions/), or other high value data (like commercial or financial information) that could cause harm or embarrassment if lost or exposed, unless your internal security team tell you it's OK
* create and use [private teams or direct messages](https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/Teams-and-channels-df38ae23-8f85-46d3-b071-cb11b9de5499) when you need to control access
* be aware of and limit [guest accounts](https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/Teams-and-channels-df38ae23-8f85-46d3-b071-cb11b9de5499#bkmk_addingguests) in your Team to your organisation if appropriate

When using Teams, you should also be aware that messages and other content persist, and can be:

* disclosed publicly under the [Freedom of Information Act](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-freedom-of-information/what-is-the-foi-act/)
* exported, viewed, and reported on by administrators including direct messages and private teams
* [subject to legal requests to shared data](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trustcenter/cloudservices/office365) by courts, government agencies, or parties involved in litigation in the US

As any Teams content can be subject to the Freedom of Information Act you should:

* communicate as you would in internal email
* choose good team and channel names

Using Teams for social or personal use must:

* not create exposure to legal liability or embarrassment
* not affect your performance or disrupt others
* follow the [Civil Service Code](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-service-code/the-civil-service-code)

Microsoft have signed up to the [EU-US Privacy Shield](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trustcenter/cloudservices/office365) which requires them to follow European data protection requirements for personal data for their European customers. [You own the data](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trustcenter/cloudservices/office365) you put in Teams, and their technical security is similar to other popular public cloud services.

### Managing information

Sometimes you may need to refer back to information shared in Teams. As a civil servant you must [keep accurate records](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-service-code/the-civil-service-code) of work. Make sure you donâ€™t lose content by:

* creating a permanent record of shared information at regular intervals or at the end of a piece of work
* using your document storage or email service to capture important discussions or decisions (name the data so it can be found later)

You can export data from Teams by:

* copying and pasting the text (while noting the date)
* taking a screenshot
* asking your administrator for an export

Limit channels to:

* work and discussion  
* networks and clubs
* noticeboards

Name channels clearly with the team, community, product, network, club, or group so it is obvious what is being discussed. Avoid creating channels without an obvious work or community purpose.

### Getting started

Ensure your account looks official and similar to other government Microsoft accounts by:

* make sure your [Office 365 profile](https://eur.delve.office.com) is accurate
* use a recognisable profile photo
* use the [quick start guide](https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/Microsoft-Teams-Quick-Start-422bf3aa-9ae8-46f1-83a2-e65720e1a34d]

Your information is only shared within your organisation, or with external guests added to your team.

You can alert others to content you have shared in Teams by typing @ and the team or channel name, or @name. This can trigger notifications on their computer or phone.

You should avoid disruption to others when using these alerts by avoiding use of @ and the team name unless you need to

### Getting help

Microsoft have a live [status page](https://status.office365.com/).

You may also access further support from:
* Microsoft's [Teams help center](https://support.office.com/en-GB/Teams)
* your internal IT team or your IT service provider
