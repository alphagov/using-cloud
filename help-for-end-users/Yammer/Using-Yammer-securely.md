## Using Yammer securely

Government staff are responsible for checking the applications they use are secure. This guidance will help you use Yammer to communicate securely with colleagues.

[Yammer](https://www.yammer.com/) is a cloud application for social networking within an organisation, or with partners, customers, or vendors. You can use it to post updates and send messages, either directly or in a group. You can also use it to share documents, join groups, and search history.

Yammer is available as a stand alone service but is more often used as part of Microsoft's Office 365 suite.

### Securing your account

Secure your Yammer account by using:

- a password made up of [3 random words](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/three-random-words-or-thinkrandom-0)
- a secure (HTTPS) connection and a [modern browser](https://whatbrowser.org)

in Office 365. Secure your Office 365 account using [two-factor authentication](https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/Set-up-2-step-verification-for-Office-365-ace1d096-61e5-449b-a875-58eb3d74de14?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-GB&amp;ad=GB). You cannot use two-factor authentication in a stand alone Yammer account.

If you think someone may have accessed your stand alone account:

- logout any other sessions in Settings - Account Activity
- reset your password in Settings - Password

You can also delete your Yammer account under Settings - Preferences - Delete Your Yammer account.

### Protecting your data

To protect your data when using Yammer, make sure you:

- don&#39;t use standalone Yammer to store [sensitive, personal](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/key-definitions/), or other high value data (like commercial or financial information) that could cause harm or embarrassment if lost or exposed - speak to your security team about what you can store in Office 365
- create and use [internal groups with private access](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/2840522/how-to-create-a-new-group-in-yammer), and [private messages](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/2842159/how-to-send-a-message-to-a-specific-person-in-yammer) when you need to control access
- Yammer is restricted to your email domain by default but you can [create external groups](https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/Create-and-manage-external-groups-in-Yammer-9ccd15ce-0efc-4dc1-81bc-4a424ab6f92a) if appropriate

When using Yammer, you should also be aware that content, including archived or private content, can be:

- disclosed publicly under the [Freedom of Information Act](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-freedom-of-information/what-is-the-foi-act/)
- [exported and viewed](https://confluence.atlassian.com/hipchatkb/exporting-chat-history-753404166.html) by administrators in paid Yammer accounts, including private messages and groups
- [subject to legal requests to share data](https://www.microsoft.com/EN-US/privacystatement/OnlineServices/Default.aspx) by courts, government agencies, or parties involved in litigation in the US

Microsoft - who run Yammer - have signed up to the [EU-US Privacy Shield](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-eu-us-privacy-shield) which requires them to follow European data protection requirements for personal data for their European customers. [You own the data](https://www.microsoft.com/EN-US/privacystatement/OnlineServices/Default.aspx) you put in Yammer, and their technical security is similar to other popular public cloud services.

### Managing information

You must record or summarise important work in a permanent record at regular intervals or at the end of a piece of work.

Make sure you don&#39;t lose content by:

- creating a permanent record of shared information at regular intervals or at the end of a piece of work
- using your document storage or email service to capture important discussions or decisions (name the data so it can be found later)

You can export data from Yammer by:

- copying and pasting the text (while noting the date)
- taking a screenshot
- asking your administrator for [an export](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Monitoring-your-Yammer-data-Yammer-Admin-Guide-8c4651fa-12c2-4ced-b4ea-2200c0a630ed) in paid accounts

### Getting started

Ensure your account looks official and similar to other government Yammer accounts by:

- use a recognisable profile photo
- add your role to the Job title section

You can alert others to content you have shared on Yammer by typing @username (their email address without the @domain.gov.uk) and by including the organisation or group name when posting an update. all or @here. This can trigger notifications on their computer or phone. Admins can post an announcement that will trigger an email alert as well as a post.

### Getting help

For help using Yammer, you can use their [getting started guide](https://docs.com/yammer-team/7415/getting-started-with-yammer).
