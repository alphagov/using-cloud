Security evaluations for cloud-based services should be done using the [Cloud Security Principles](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cloud-service-security-principles/cloud-service-security-principles) and [related guidance](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/cloud-security-collection).

There is no expectation that cloud suppliers will meet the aims of all security principles.  It's likely assurance will come from a combination of supplier assertion, contractual commitment and independent or customer validation.
